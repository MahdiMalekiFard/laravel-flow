## <span style="color: lightblue;">What is a workflow?</span>

#### Two concepts define a workflow in team-managed projects:
>1. <b style="color:green;">Statuses</b> - the steps in your team’s working process that describe the state of a task.
>2. <b style="color:green;">Transitions</b> – how a piece of work can move between statuses.


## <span style="color: lightblue;">What are workflow statuses?</span>
>Statuses help people understand the state of a piece of work.
They appear in many views across your site.

## <span style="color: lightblue;">What are workflow transitions?</span>
>Transitions connect statuses and help define the flow of work in your project.

>These pathways define how people move pieces of work through your workflow.
For example, if you run a pizza shop, you might have different statuses depending on who’s picking up the pizza.
Once the pizza is “Ready for pickup”, it can move down the “Send for delivery” transition, putting it in the “On the way” status.
Or, it can transition down the “Give to customer” transition, showing that the pizza work is done.
